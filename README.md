Rar is the Library thats currently being worked on. sorry for my oranization, im new to gethub and if thinks look weird im sorry but im defenitly trying to get this library correct. The problem seems to happen with both Lines and the Highlight Bar... removing them and only using an arrow allows for working fuctionality so theirfor the problem lyes in the fill rectangle and draw line of either the gfx or adafruit.. this occurs on multiple ssd1306 so "cheapness isnt the issues expecialy due to the fact ive mixed and matched different panels with controller board and receiving different outcome. something has to be the case.. buffer? contrast? something is wrong making it not compatable with ALL SSD1306 OLEDs

MinimalSSD1306_Test0.001- progress bars need fix as the screen glitches and flickers. The other test/demos are fine and working.
